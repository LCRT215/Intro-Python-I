Polya's Method
    In 1945 George Polya published the book How To Solve It which quickly became
    his most prized publication. U.P.E.R. is his four-step process for problem solving, which is used all over to aid people in problem solving.

- Understand
- Plan
- Execute
- Reflect

1. Understand the problem
    - Tech Stack
    - Edge cases
    - Input/output
    - Time/performance

2. Devise a plan
    - "First pass solution"
    - Reflect on experience/similar
    - Pseudo Code! (very important. In a lot of case, the pseudo code will be very similar to the actual python code)
    - Diagrams
    - Break down the problem into smaller pieces
    - Perfection is the enemy of good!

3. Execute the plan
    - Start to actually code!

4. Reflect
    - How can this code be improved?
    - D.R.Y.
    - Performance?
    - Easy to read?
    - Edge cases?
    - Go back to the previous steps*
